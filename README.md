# Parrrot

## About Parrrot

Parrrot is a cross-plattform software (using Electron) enabling you to use a voice parrot on amateur radio rigs that do not have one built in by feeding voice and CAT from your personal computer.

Parrrot needs a running instance of FLRig to handle mode switching and PTT. Start FLRig before starting Parrrot.
